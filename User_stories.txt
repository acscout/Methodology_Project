Your local family hero and philanthropist Shaggy loves playing squares with all of his friends during his favorite sporting events. Shaggy does not like having to draw out the squares by hand because his great strength makes it difficult to hold mortal pencils. So he goes onto the SquareSports website and quickly creates a football square for the big game. By filling out his squares online or simply printing the squares template he can get squares as perfect as he is without destroying any pencils.

I got a couple root beers with the boys on the big Sunday game; in order to spice things up, one friend offers a friendly wager: a game of squares. Roberto quickly pulls out his phone and opens SquareSports, and makes a board in less than 5 seconds. We were able to make a game of squares before Green Bay picked up a quick touchdown return. It was so easy, I could gloat about the early head start without worrying about tallying the points
